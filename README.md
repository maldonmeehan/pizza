#### _Create a website where a user can order a pizza _

#### By _**Maldon Meehan**_

## Description

_This is the final Epicodus student project for Intro to Programing Week 4. The assignment was to create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost._
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
